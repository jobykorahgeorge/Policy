    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Add Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This application is designed to securely store and manage your data 
        <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data to external servers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information.  
        All data you enter—such as expenses, income, investments, notes, or passwords—remains fully stored on your device.
        We have no access to this data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored solely within the app's private storage area on your device.  
        It is not uploaded, synced, shared, or transmitted over the internet.  
        You may delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the app or using in-app clearing options (if available).
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> share your data with anyone, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertisers</li>
        <li>Third-party companies or services</li>
        <li>Analytics or tracking systems</li>
        <li>External servers or cloud platforms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since your data never leaves your device, sharing is not technically possible.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>
        The app may request certain device permissions solely for its functionality.  
        Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong> – to store your data locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Biometric / Fingerprint</strong> – if you enable the in-app vault lock or secure access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use these permissions to collect any information.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect or store data from children.  
        The app does not connect to any server or process online interactions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        If we introduce online or cloud features in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
    </p>
